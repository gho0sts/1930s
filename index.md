# 1930s Ventures

***The 1930s may have been the most technologically progressive decade of the 20th Century. - Marc Andreessen***

Today, the world is facing similar problems like those happen in the 1930s. But we don’t see many Elon-like of innovator trying to solve the hardest problems in current society, or Einstein-like of researcher dare to think above and beyond. The current capital system is collecting the smartest mind in the world to improve their ad click rate, camera filter, and food delivery. The talent also believes they are making the world a better place, but the truth is that just a few people are willing to take the risk to solve the complex problem in the complex world.

That’s the reason why we are building 1930s. As a human being, we need to dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to make the unknown known. We need to bring back those spirits from the Titans in the 30s. 

So, We want to back the most ambitious minds in the era.
